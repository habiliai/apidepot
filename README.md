# API Depot
API Depot is under active development. This open-source repository will be updated regularly. We are building it as a platform for co-hosting APIs for AI agents.

## Overview
API Depot is a simple API management tool for AI agents. It is built on top of a Kubernetes cluster to host APIs. The tool provides basic APIs and a manageable VAPI via gRPC. We implemented API Depot as a gRPC service to facilitate communication with other services.

## Features
